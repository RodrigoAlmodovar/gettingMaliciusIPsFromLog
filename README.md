# gettingMaliciusIPsFromLog

This is an exercise for those who are starting with bash scripting & sysadmin.
##Story
There has been some malicious interactions with some servers inside the network that you are administrating, your mission is to create a bash script that check the log file, guess which IPs are causing problems and react on time before they continue doing bad things.
The log file is the one called: ACCESS_LOG_CORREGIDO.log
There are several ways to solve this problem. A possible solution is described in the getBadIps.sh file but, please, think by yourself and don't cheat!
